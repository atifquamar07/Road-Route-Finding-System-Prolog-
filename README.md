# Road-Route-Finding-System-Prolog
A Road Route finding system using Prolog. The system first reads data from
a CSV file to generate facts about the distance between two cities and also the heuristic
values for the same in the knowledge base as predicates. Then implements either a best-first
search algorithm (heuristic algorithm) or a depth-first search algorithm to find road-route
between the cities. Also displays the total distance travelled.
